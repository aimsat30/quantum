        <p><b>Quantum Installation Group, LLC</b> (“Contractor”) hereby issues this Construction Purchase Order (“Purchase Order”) to Subcontractor to perform construction services for the above-identified Project in accordance with the scope of work as set forth below (“Work”).  This Purchase Order is being issued in accordance with and pursuant to the definitions, terms, and conditions of that certain Master Subcontractor Agreement Contractor and Subcontractor (hereinafter “MSA”).</p>
        <p>
            <b><u>1. The Work.</u></b> Contractor contracts with Subcontractor as an independent contractor to provide all labor, materials, equipment, and services necessary or incidental to complete the Work for the Project as described in further detail in Addendum A hereto, in good and workman like fashion, free of defects, and in accordance with industry standards as well as the Contract Documents (including, but not limited to, the Specifications, Drawings, Sketches, Addenda and Other Purchase Order  Documents attached hereto as Addendum B), and consistent and in compliance with the Project Schedule (attached hereto as Addendum C), as may change from time to time (hereinafter, the “Work”). Subcontractor shall perform the Work under the general direction of Contractor. Subcontractor acknowledges and agrees that the Work includes the provision of all equipment, components, systems, materials, documentation and other services and items required to perform the Work and make it complete, functional and/or operational, notwithstanding the fact that each such service or item may not be expressly mentioned in the Contract Documents. Subcontractor shall obtain all required permits to perform the Work and shall furnish Contractor with a copy of the same. Subcontractor shall comply with all codes, safety ordinances, local, state, and federal laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the Work. Subcontractor shall keep the Project site clean and free from debris resulting from the Work. <br><br>

            <b><u>2. Purchase Order Amount.</u></b>	As full consideration for complete performance of the Work, and except for increases or decreases by change order as provided in the MSA, Contractor shall pay Subcontractor pursuant to the payment terms in the MSA in the following amounts, known as the Purchase Order Amount. <br><br>

            <b><u>3. Addenda. </u></b> Subcontractor shall perform the Work in accordance with and comply with all requirements contained in the following Addenda, each of which is included as an integral part of this Purchase Order and incorporated into this Purchase Order by reference.

                <li>Addendum C: Project Schedule</li>
            </ul> 
            <b><u>4. Owner’s Payment to Contractor as Condition Precedent.</u></b> Subcontractor acknowledges and agrees that Owner’s payment to Contractor under the Prime Agreement of amounts due Subcontractor under this Purchase Order and/or the MSA is an express an unwaivable condition precedent to Contractor’s obligation to pay such amounts to Subcontractor. Subcontractor further acknowledges that it is relying on the credit and ability of Owner, and not Contractor, to pay for Work performed.  Subcontractor accepts all risk that it will not be paid by Contractor for Work performed in the event Owner does not pay Contractor for such Work.  One or multiple payments by Contractor to Subcontractor prior to payment by Owner for Subcontractor’s relevant Work shall not constitute a waiver of Contractor’s rights and defenses under this <u>Section 5. </u><br><br>

            <b><u>5. Miscellaneous </u></b> This Purchase Order and the MSA represent the entire integrated agreement between the parties with respect to the Project and the Work and supersede all prior negotiations, proposals, correspondence, representations or agreements, whether written or oral, express or implied. This Purchase Order may only be amended or modified in or by a written Amendment, written Change Order, or other writing signed by both Contractor and Subcontractor. The failure of Contractor to enforce at any time or for any period of time any one or more of the provisions of the MSA or this Purchase Order shall not be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions.  No defense, privilege, right, or other term of the MSA or this Purchase Order may be waived orally or by conduct, and instead may only be waived by an express and undisputable waiver in writing signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced. This Purchase Order and the MSA and all of the provisions of both will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Purchase Order of the MSA shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Georgia. This Purchase Order and the MSA are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns and nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give any person, other than the parties hereto and such permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder. This Purchase Order may be executed and delivered in one or more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one person, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Purchase Order by electronic mail or facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a mutually executed counterpart to this Purchase Order.<br><br>
